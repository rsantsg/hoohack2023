Story
When looking through the project prompts, the Twilio prompt immediately stuck out to us. Our first thoughts went to how we may be able to autotomize tasks for people. This is where we found our project inspiration, we decided to create a way to automatically make a phone call to schedule various appointments. Its becoming more and more common to see people, usually young adults make phone calls for important appointments. Rather than sacrifice their physical health to preserve their mental health, we have provided an option that helps mitigate the stress that this can cause.  We implemented all of this functionality utilizing Twilio.

Elevator pitch
With the rise of texting, making phone calls has become a chore and for some, a source of anxiety. In order to reduce this, we have developed a system to automatically make your appointment phone calls for you! 
"good afternoon, I was calling to make a appointment type for name on date. 
wait for response for  times available
I would like the earlier/later appointment please. Thank you, have a good day"
